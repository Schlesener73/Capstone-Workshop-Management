I had an initial phone call with Dr. H to discuss the project.  We had a high-level discussion about what the web application will do and how it would be structured.  It will consist of a front end user interface where workshops can be created and maintained.  Inside a workshop, participants can be added along with what equipment they check out.  It will consist of a back end database consisting of three tables; a workshop table, a personnel table, and an equipment table.

I had a Zoom meeting with Dr. H where he confirmed that I had submitted all of reports.  He advised me to get the database tables set up and to start working on the front end user interface.  He said to start by focusing on getting one small part working so that it is able to read from and write to the database.
